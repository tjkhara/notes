# pointing domain name

This is first done in namecheap and then in digital ocean

A record is used to point the domain name to the ip address.

When creating an A record:

## Type is A Record

Host can be blank or @

Value is the ip address


## Canonical name record (CNAME record)

This is pointed to another domain and never directly to an ip address.

Type CNAME record

Host www

Value tjkhara.xyz.

## Sub domain is an A record

Example:

sub.example.com points to 193.184.216.34
